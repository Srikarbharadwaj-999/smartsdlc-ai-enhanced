## 📖 Overview

The Smart SDLC project allows users to:

- Input user stories via a front-end interface.
- Call IBM Watsonx’s LLM API in the backend.
- Generate relevant, high-quality test cases based on that story.
- View and use the test cases in real-time.

This project bridges the gap between **manual test writing** and **intelligent automation** using **Generative AI** technologies.
